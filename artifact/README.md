# Overview

## Getting Started Guide

- Setup instructions
- Basic testing of the artifact

## Step-by-Step Instructions

- How to reproduce any experiments or other activities that support the conclusions in the paper.

- If the artifact runs for more than a few minutes, point this out, note how long it is expected to run (roughly) and explain how to run it on smaller inputs.

- Descriptions of and links to files (included in the archive) that represent expected outputs (e.g., the log files expected to be generated by your tool on the given inputs); if there are warnings that are safe to be ignored, explain which ones they are.

- A list of claims from the paper supported by the artifact, and how/why.

- A list of claims from the paper not supported by the artifact, and why not. (Dynamite takes advantage of multicore systems (e.g., our evaluation uses a 20-core machine))

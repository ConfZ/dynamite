# Overview

# Getting Started Guide

The Dynamite project is hosted at the Github repository https://github.com/letonchanh/dynamite which is actively being developed. The artifact for the paper "DynamiTe: Dynamic Termination and Non-termination Proofs" is available to download at 

## Setup instructions

The simplest way to setup Dynamite is building its Docker image using the provided Dockerfile and running Dynamite within the image with the following steps:

0. Install Docker

    Follow the instructions on https://docs.docker.com/install/. You may need to run docker commands with `sudo` or similar privileges.

1. Build the Dynamite's Docker image
    ```
    docker build -t dynamite .
    ```
    The image is built upon the pre-built base image `letonchanh/dynamite:base` on Docker Hub. The base image contains all dependencies to run Dynamite and it can also be built offline with the following command
    ```
    docker build -f Dockerfile.base -t dynamite_base .
    ```
    
2. Run the Docker image
    ```
    docker run -it dynamite bash
    ```

## Basic testing of the artifact

# Step-by-Step Instructions

- How to reproduce any experiments or other activities that support the conclusions in the paper.

- If the artifact runs for more than a few minutes, point this out, note how long it is expected to run (roughly) and explain how to run it on smaller inputs.

- Descriptions of and links to files (included in the archive) that represent expected outputs (e.g., the log files expected to be generated by your tool on the given inputs); if there are warnings that are safe to be ignored, explain which ones they are.

- A list of claims from the paper supported by the artifact, and how/why.

- A list of claims from the paper not supported by the artifact, and why not. (Dynamite takes advantage of multicore systems (e.g., our evaluation uses a 20-core machine))
